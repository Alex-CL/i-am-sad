# I-am-sad :(

I-am-sad is a project built with React + NextJS + TypeScript. At the moment, there is no linked backend, so data will not be persisted (only treated as fixtures or "fake data").

Using [this API](https://github.com/aravindasiva/demotivational-quotes-api), you'll get random sad/gloomy quotes, and then you'll mark those you like as favourites.

I tried Django Framework, but I couldn't make it work. That's why backend folder is included, although it's not built with Docker or connected with React.

## Installation

First of all, run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

to install all dependencies. Then, run this:

```bash 
yarn dev
```

and you will see the application running at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

I used Yarn to make this project, but if you prefer NPM, simply run these commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Credits
I don't own any credits of [this API](https://github.com/aravindasiva/demotivational-quotes-api), and I don't have any type of relation with people who colaborated on it.

I'm only developing this as a technical challenge for a job position. Wish me luck!
